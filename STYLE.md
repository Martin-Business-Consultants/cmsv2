# Style

How code in this repo is written. The model is 37signals' Fizzy
(`~/Projects/mbc/fizzy`, its `STYLE.md` and `AGENTS.md`), adapted to a CMS with
a public API, plugins and RSpec. When in doubt, find similar code here and
copy its shape. Reference implementations:

- **Page** (`app/models/page.rb`, `app/models/page/*`, `app/controllers/api/pages*`,
  `app/views/api/pages/*`, `spec/models/page/*`): a rich model in concerns, verbs
  that record events, thin admin and API controllers, jbuilder JSON.
- **Collection and CollectionEntry** (`app/models/collection/*`,
  `app/models/collection_entry/*`, `app/controllers/api/collections/*`,
  `app/views/api/collection_entries/*`): the same, for an aggregate of two
  models, with bulk verbs (`CollectionEntry.trash_all`, `.change_status_of`)
  that record what they found.
- **Invoice, in a plugin** (the Commerce plugin's repository:
  `app/models/invoice.rb`, `app/models/invoice/*`,
  `app/jobs/invoice/delivery_job.rb`): a plugin's model in concerns
  (`Deliverable`: `deliver_later`/`deliver_now`), with a shallow job named for
  its record.
- **Redirect** (`app/models/redirect/*`, `app/controllers/tools/redirects*`):
  a small aggregate, a plain object (`Redirect::Import`), CSV resources.
- **BlockType, Global and Asset** (`app/models/block_type/*`,
  `app/models/global/*`, `app/models/asset/*`, `app/models/bulk_upload/*`):
  plain objects nested under their model (`BlockType::Validator`,
  `BlockType::Defaults`, `Asset::Resolver`); a job's work moved onto the model
  so the job only calls it (`BulkUpload::Unpackable`, `BulkUpload::UnpackJob`);
  and two event vocabularies kept side by side where the API has always used
  its own (`BlockType::Tracked`).
- **The operational areas** (`app/controllers/api/{service_tokens,webhooks,
  deploys,trash,api_tokens}/*`, `app/models/trash.rb`, `app/models/deploys.rb`,
  `app/models/manifest.rb`): decisions that record themselves
  (`ServiceToken#reveal`), module-level verbs for things with no single record
  (`Trash.restore`, `Deploys.trigger_later`), and the manifest as a plain
  object the view renders.
- Fizzy: `app/models/card.rb` and `app/models/card/*`, `app/controllers/cards/*`,
  `app/models/concerns/eventable.rb`, `app/views/cards/*.json.jbuilder`.

`spec/architecture/*` enforces the structural rules below, with no
exceptions: no `app/services` anywhere, no `member`/`collection` routes, and
no hand-built success JSON in API controllers. A new exception means changing
the rule here first.

## Models

Behaviour lives on models. A controller calls an intention-revealing method
(`page.trash`, `page.update_schema(fields)`, `Page.change_status_of(pages, to:)`)
rather than a service.

- Split a model by what it does into concerns under `app/models/<model>/`,
  named for the capability they add: `Page::Publishable`, `Page::Treeable`,
  `Page::Trashable`, `Redirect::Matchable`. Each concern holds its own
  associations, scopes, callbacks and methods. One `include` per line: they
  register in order.
- Keep in the model file what depends on order across concerns
  (validations, in the order their errors are reported) and the model's
  external contract (webhook payload).
- A collaborator that isn't a record is a plain Ruby object in `app/models`,
  namespaced under what it serves (`Page::BlockExpansion`, `Redirect::Import`).
- There is no `app/services`, in the core or in a plugin. An orchestrator
  with no record of its own (`Upgrade::Hoster`, `Deploys`) is a plain object
  in `app/models` like any other; an HTTP client is one too, as in Fizzy's
  `Webhook::Delivery`.
- A behaviour two records share, where neither owns it, is a concern in
  `app/models/concerns` named for what it adds (`Sitemapped` for pages and
  entries). A question asked of a whole table is a class method on a
  concern of that model (`CollectionEntry.trash_all`).
- Callbacks are for derived data and fan-out only: paths, search index,
  references, versions, webhooks. A business action is an explicit method
  someone calls.

## Events

Everything that happens goes out through `Event` (`app/models/event.rb`),
Fizzy's Event with two kinds, one per audience. A model reaches both through
`Eventable`:

```ruby
def trash
  track_event(:deleted, path: path, status: status)   # who did what
  discard!
end

announce("invoice.paid")                               # what changed, for subscribers
```

- **`track_event`** records something a person or token did. It writes the
  audit row (`"page.deleted"`: the model's `eventable_prefix`, then the
  action) attributed to `Current.actor` with the request's address and user
  agent, adds `via: "api"` on `/api` requests, and publishes `"event.cms"`
  in-process. Every write through the admin or the API records one.
  `Model.track_event` records an event about a set of records (a bulk
  change), naming the records it found, not the ones it was asked for.
  `Event.record("settings.brand_updated", …)` is for events about no
  record. Record before a destructive change, so the row names the record
  as it was; a verb records its own event (`invoice.void!`,
  `webhook.regenerate_secret!`), and for plain CRUD the controller calls
  `record.track_event` after the save.
- **`announce`** publishes a state change in the webhook vocabulary
  (`page.published`, `submission.created`): in-process as
  `"<event>.cms"`, to every webhook that wants it
  (`Webhook.deliver_later` → `Webhook::DeliveryJob` → `deliver_now`), to the
  record's own subscribers (`notify_subscribers`, a collection's emails) and
  to the deploy hook. Content models announce from `Announceable`, which
  works the transition out from what the save changed, so no path that
  saves a record can forget to.

The audit log and the webhooks are two vocabularies on purpose: one
editorial action can announce several transitions (a bulk publish), and an
announcement can have no person behind it (the scheduler, a visitor's form
submission).

Within the audit log there is **one vocabulary**: an act is recorded under
the same action and the same metadata whether the admin or the API did it,
and only `via: "api"` tells them apart. Name actions `<model>.<past-tense
verb>` (`block_type.deleted`, `asset_folder.renamed`,
`site_backup.exported`), and record through the model's verb so both routes
share it (`Deploys.configure`, `CollectionEntry#place_on_board`,
`ReviewRequest.summary_of`). Keep actions and metadata stable once
recorded: `/api/audit_log` shows them. When one must change, add the old
name to `AuditLog::FORMER_NAMES`, so filtering by the new name still finds
older rows and the admin shows them under it; old rows are never rewritten.
Webhook names and payloads are a contract with every receiver and never
change.

## Controllers

- CRUD only. A verb that isn't CRUD becomes a resource of its own:
  `resources :bulk_deletions` rather than `post :bulk_destroy`,
  `resource :schema` rather than `patch :update_schema`. The API keeps its
  URLs by routing an old path to the new controller
  (`post "pages/bulk_destroy", to: "pages/bulk_deletions#create"`).
- Thin: load, authorize, call the model, render. Plain Active Record calls
  are fine (`@page.update!(page_params)`).
- A controller nested under a record loads it through a `<Model>Scoped`
  concern (`PageScoped`; in the API, `Api::WebhookScoped`,
  `Api::ServiceTokenScoped`, `Api::TrashScoped`). A lookup that fails with a
  JSON body (an unknown trash kind, an unknown recipe) renders it in the
  concern's before_action.
- Every action declares its capability (`requires_capability "pages:write",
  only: …`); authorization fails closed.

## JSON and the API

- JSON is built in jbuilder views under `app/views/api/<resource>/`, with a
  partial per shape (`_page`, `_summary`). Controllers `render json:` only
  for error bodies (`{error: …}`), with `error:` on the render's first line.
- List keys in `json.extract!` in the order the old `as_json(only: [...])`
  listed them: that list set the order the API has always answered in.
- Jbuilder encodes like `render json:` (config/initializers/jbuilder.rb):
  "&", "<" and ">" come out as themselves, not `\u0026`. Without it any text
  with those characters changed bytes the moment its endpoint moved to a view.
- An error body the contract starts with another key (device login's
  `{status: "error", error: …}`) is a view too (`api/device_authorizations/error`).
- Don't name a partial's local `collection:` (or `as:`): jbuilder reads
  either as "render once per item". The collection partial takes `record:`.
- `/api` is its own namespace with a frozen contract: the Astro sites, the
  `cms` CLI, Lumin and agents read it. Before changing anything an endpoint
  touches, snapshot its responses (status, body, the `X-Agent-Envelope: 1`
  variant, error cases, and the audit rows and jobs a write leaves) under
  frozen time, and diff after. They must come out byte-identical.
  `spec/contracts` and `spec/cli` must stay green unchanged.

## Jobs

Shallow jobs that call a model method, namespaced by model
(`app/jobs/<model>/`). A method that enqueues is `foo_later`; when the job
calls back into the same class, the synchronous method is `foo_now`.

## The app

- **One install per site.** No tenancy. `Site.key` and `Site.host` come from
  the environment.
- **`Current`** holds the request's user, session, token, address and user
  agent; models read it (`Current.actor`), controllers set it.
- **Plugins** are engines (`docs/plugins.md`): `engines/hello`, the
  reference, ships with the core; the rest are installed into `plugins/` from
  their own repositories. The core never names a plugin: it offers
  registries (menu, slots, settings, permissions, events, …) and plugins
  register into them.
- **One gate: anything in front of visitors takes the publish capability.**
  Changing a live record (a published page or entry, or any global), or
  publishing or scheduling a draft, needs `<resource>:publish`; the record
  answers (`PublishGated#publishing_write?`, asked after the attributes are
  assigned). Without it the write is refused, not queued: the admin's
  `ContentEditing` adds an error and re-renders, the API's
  `Api::PublishCapability` answers 403. Any new write path that can change a
  live record, `status` or `publish_at` asks the same question.

## Views

ERB with Herb/ReActionView, Stimulus and Turbo, no build step.
`bundle exec herb lint app/views engines` must pass. Every partial declares
strict locals; no ERB output in attribute names; no inline styles.

### Styling: Litewind

The admin is styled with Tailwind utility classes in the markup, from
[Litewind](https://github.com/reallygoodsoftware/litewind) 2.0.1: Tailwind v4
compiled ahead of time into one stylesheet
(`vendor/assets/stylesheets/litewind-2.0.1.css`, loaded first by
`app_stylesheet_tags`), so there's still no build step. The look follows
Payload's admin: near-monochrome and flat, a white canvas with a gray-50
sidebar, gray-200 hairlines, compact controls, the primary button in the
brand's color (black until one is set).

- **Classes, not stylesheets, say how a thing looks.** Spacing, type, color,
  borders, corners and shadows go in `class`. `app/assets/stylesheets` holds
  only what classes can't say: state the markup doesn't carry (`:hover` on a
  parent, `:focus-within`, `:has()`, `[open]`, `html[data-menu="folded"]`,
  classes JavaScript toggles), behaviour (fixed positioning that reads a
  variable, animations, dialogs), third-party DOM (Lexxy), element
  defaults (`base.css`: native form controls, focus rings) and the tokens
  (`_global.css`). Those rules hang on a BEM hook (`admin-menu__submenu`) and
  read Litewind's tokens (`var(--color-gray-200)`, `var(--radius-lg)`).
- **Repeated pieces come from `UiHelper#ui`**: `ui(:button)`,
  `ui(:button, :primary)`, `ui(:button, :plain, :small)`, `ui(:button, :danger)`
  (outlined) and `ui(:button, :destructive)` (filled, for the confirming
  button in a delete dialog), `ui(:panel)`, `ui(:dialog)` (on a
  `<dialog class="dialog …">`, dialog.css), `ui(:sheet)` (a `<dialog>` that
  slides in from the right; it carries its hooks),
  `ui(:menu)`, `ui(:menu_item)`, `ui(:badge, :green)`, `ui(:notice, :red)`,
  `ui(:page_title)`, `ui(:heading)`, `ui(:label)`, `ui(:help)`, `ui(:link)`,
  `ui(:table)`, `ui(:th)`, `ui(:td)`. Add layout as a string,
  `ui(:button, :small, "w-full")`, never a class the recipe already sets a
  property for (no `items-center` beside a recipe's `items-start`).
- **Only Litewind's classes exist.** It has most of Tailwind but not all
  (no `dark:`, `group-*`, `focus-within:`, arbitrary values or opacity
  modifiers; few `focus:` variants). A missing utility goes in
  `tailwind-extras.css` under Tailwind's name and definition.
  `spec/architecture/litewind_classes_spec.rb` fails on a class nothing
  defines and on two classes that set the same property on one element;
  in specs, `ui` and `class_names` raise on the second (`spec/support/litewind.rb`).
  Class lists kept in a variable are named `*_classes` so the spec reads them.
- **Everything respects Settings › Branding's color, type and surface.**
  Markup draws only with tokens the branding sets (`_global.css`,
  `Branding#stylesheet`), so a workspace's branding reaches every screen:
  - *Color*: two families mean something. `gray` is the neutral, every step
    mixed from `--neutral-tint` (the secondary color tints it, faintly).
    `blue` is the accent, read from `--accent-*`: the primary color, or an
    ink until one is set. Use blue for primary buttons, links, focus,
    selection and what's current. `red`, `green` and `yellow` are for status.
    Litewind has no `dark:`, so the dark theme re-points these families'
    steps: write the light theme's classes and the dark one follows. No
    other family, no `black`, no hex. Words on a `bg-blue-*` fill are
    `text-on-accent`.
  - *Type*: `--font-sans`, the branding's font. Don't set another family
    (`font-mono` for code is fine).
  - *Surface*: corners are `rounded-sm|md|lg|xl` (and `-t-`, `-b-`… with a
    size), which the branding's corners set; never bare `rounded`. Shadows
    are `shadow-surface` (panels) and `shadow-overlay` (menus, dialogs,
    sheets, toasts), which its shadow sets; never `shadow-sm|lg|xl`.
  CSS follows the same rule (`var(--color-gray-200)`, `var(--radius-lg)`,
  `var(--shadow-overlay)`). The classes spec fails on a class that bypasses
  a token.
- **Don't put a display utility on something a stylesheet shows and hides**
  (`flex`, `hidden`, `block` beat a component rule's `display: none`): let
  the stylesheet set its display.
- **Which corner where**: `rounded-md` for controls (buttons, inputs, menu
  items), `rounded-lg` for notices, `rounded-xl` for panels, menus and
  dialogs, `rounded-sm` for badges, `rounded-full` only for true circles.
- **Hooks**: keep a BEM class only while a stylesheet, JavaScript or a spec
  reads it; the classes spec reports one nothing reads.
- Mailers keep their own inline styles: email clients don't load the admin's.

Screens follow WordPress's admin conventions:

- One primary action per screen, `ui(:button, :primary)`; everything else
  is a secondary, outlined `ui(:button)`. A title row's "Add New" is secondary.
- Editors (pages, entries, globals) put the title and permalink first and
  the content in the main column, with a sidebar of boxes
  (`content_form_helper#postbox`) led by the Publish box
  (`content_form/_publish_box`): Save Draft, Status/schedule lines with an
  Edit, Move to Trash, and the primary Publish / Update (none for a role
  that can't publish).
- A delete dialog inside another form takes `form:` and a
  `layouts/shared/delete_form` rendered after that form. Forms can't nest,
  and a nested form's `_method=delete` would join the outer one.

## Ruby

- Prefer expanded conditionals over guard clauses, except a guard at the top
  of a non-trivial method.
- Order methods: class methods, then public (`initialize` first), then
  private; within each, in the order they're called.
- `!` only for a method that has a counterpart without it
  (`update_schema` / `update_schema!`), never to flag something destructive.
- RuboCop (`bin/rubocop`) is the formatter's word: no blank line after
  `private`, and methods under it are not indented.

## Tests

RSpec with factory_bot. Model specs per concern (`spec/models/page/*_spec.rb`)
for verbs and events; request specs for controllers, HTML and JSON; contract
specs for the API. A structural rule gets an architecture spec.
