# frozen_string_literal: true

# One content change, as a rebuild or a cache purge hears of it (Deploys):
# what happened, to what, where it lives on the site, and the cache tags a
# server-rendered site tagged that content's responses with.

# The tags are the one vocabulary the CMS and the site share (the delivery
# API sends them in a Cache-Tag header):
#
#   page:<path>                 a page, by its path ("page:about", "page:" for the home page)
#   entry:<collection>/<slug>   an entry
#   collection:<slug>           anything listing a collection's entries
#   global:<slug>               a global (nav, footer…)
#   pages                       anything listing pages (navigation built from the tree)
#   sitemap                     the sitemap
