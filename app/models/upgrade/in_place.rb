# Updates a Docker install in place, the way WordPress updates itself (and
# Runwell does): downloads the release's bundle (the app as its image holds
# it, gems, compiled assets and the default plugins included, built for each
# architecture by .github/workflows/release.yml) into releases/ in the data
# directory, checks it, points releases/current at it and restarts the
# container. On boot bin/docker-entrypoint runs whichever is newer, the image
# or releases/current, then backs up and migrates as always. Deploying a newer
# image takes over again.
#
# Each bundle carries the Ruby its gems were built for (config/bundled_ruby.rb
# switches to it), so a new Ruby comes this way too. A release that needs
# other system packages or Debian (CMS_BASE in the Dockerfile) can't: it
# redeploys through Hoster or GitHub when the install can, else fails with how.
# Plugins installed from Settings › Plugins live in the data volume and carry
# over; one the image carries that the bundle doesn't (from CMS_PLUGINS)
# would be lost, so the update refuses and says so.
